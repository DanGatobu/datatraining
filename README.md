## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook summarizing data science tools and the ecosystem. It serves as a beginner's guide to data science, introducing data science languages, libraries, and basic arithmetic expressions.

## Objectives

- List data science languages.
- List data science libraries.
- Introduce arithmetic expressions.
- Perform simple arithmetic operations (multiply and add numbers).

## Languages and Libraries

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
1. Python
2. SQL
3. R

Some of the commonly used libraries by Data Scientists include:
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn
4. Scikit-learn

## Data Science Tools

The tools commonly used by Data Scientists include:
- R Studio
- Visual Studio Code
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Examples

### Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions in Python

Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:

```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
answer = (3 * 4) + 5
print(answer)

# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
